PROJECT 4 WRITE-UP
------------------

1) Briefly explain how you implemented comparison queries and how they affected your control block's signals (in a few sentences).

ANSWER
There's two parts to our comparison query,  found within the "CM Stuff" box. The left circuit compares the result of the operation once it's finished with the ALU ("ALU Result") to figure out whether it's less than, equal to, or greater than. Then it uses the tunnels to report out the result using the multiplexer. 

2) Please list your control block's control signals, and briefly explain what each one does (in a sentence or less each).

ANSWER
Our control block has 4 different parts. If the OP code is 


3) What features (if any) of this assembly language do you like?

ANSWER
I like that the CQ instruction allows more flexibility in the comparisons compared to MIPS, where you have a choice between beq for just equal and writing multiple lines for every other kind of comparison. 

4) What features (if any) of this assembly language do you not like?

ANSWER
I don't like that the CQ instruction, which is analogous to the BEQ instruction in MIPS, requires two lines to do the same instruction, whereas it can be done with a single line in MIPS.
